Description: This package uses nu support vector regression to predict the normalized FL B cell state values in FL gene expression samples
  derived from bulk biopsies. The signature is trained from bulk RNAseq samples which had matching RNAseq from bulk B cell aliquots of FL biopsies.
  In this case, the svr trains to predict the signature matrix, which makes the coefficient values our result. This means a new model is generated
  for each sample and any number of samples can be run. At this time, RNAseq in the form of log2TPM+1 has been validated to work. The function will
  automatically detect non-log expression and convert to log2(+1). If using gene expression from other sources, such as GEP, a batch correct option
  is available using 'batch_correct = TRUE'.  This re-aligns the input data to a more appropriate data space for prediction.
